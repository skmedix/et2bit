                              Imagine making something using lego bricks -
                              the lego bricks of mapping are called
                              Brushes.&nbsp; By putting brushes together you
                              can make terrain, buildings and all the things
                              inside them.&nbsp; Given enough time, and
                              brushes, you can create a whole environment in
                              which the players can run around shooting each
                              other.

                                But unlike lego bricks where you are limited
                                to the number, shape and colour of the
                                bricks in your lego set, in Radiant you can
                                create as many bricks, with whatever size,
                                shape and colours as you want.

                                    will find it very hard to get the major

                                      Quick mention of scale: the grid unit
                                      measurement equates more or less to 1
                                      inch in the real world.&nbsp; So I
                                      assume a player is 72 units high and
                                          make ordinary doors 84 units high to
                                      give about a foot clearance.

                              window.&nbsp; The 2D allows precise movement
                              in any axis, while the 3D gives you a more
                              intuitive feel for placing something just
                              where you want it.&nbsp; Ensure the brush to
                              be moved is selected.&nbsp; You can move
                              multiple brushes if they are all selected.

                                    by first changing the 2D view (cycle through
                                    the view by ctrl+tab).&nbsp; Generally if
                                    you have used ctrl+tab, make sure you end up

                              Brushes can be resized in the 2D or 3D
                              window.&nbsp; The 2D allows precise movement
                              in any axis, while the 3D is best used only
                              when the axis for change is clearly seen and
                              controlled via the mouse, otherwise you are
                              likely to drag the brush into the wrong size
                              in an unintended axis.&nbsp; 2D is
                              clearest.&nbsp; Ensure the brush to be resized
                              is selected.&nbsp; You can resize multiple
                              brushes if they are all selected and you want
                              to resize them in the same dimension.
                              <p>
                                To resize a brush in the 2D window, put the
                                cursor just outside the edge of the brush
                                and click/drag.&nbsp; When you drag you
                                resize in the direction you drag in - drag
                                away to make larger, drag inward to make
                                smaller.

                                Have a go at resizing the brush in each of
                                    the 3 dimensions.&nbsp; When you're done,
                                    leave the brush as shown in these pictures
                                    (a flat square).&nbsp; On subsequent views
                                    of the map you may need to reverse a little
                                    in the 3D window in order to see the
                                    square.&nbsp; This is because the camera
                                    will start at the origin (0,0,0) and will be
                                looking at the inside.

                              Textures - what's that all about then?
                              <p>
                                A texture is the name given to the image
                                applied to the face of a brush.
                              </p>

                              <p>
                                A brush typically has 6 faces, all of which
                                will have a texture applied.&nbsp; At the
                                simplest level a texture on a face will be a
                                JPG or TGA file of anything from a single
                                colour up to an image of the Mona
                                    Lisa.&nbsp; Some special textures are used
                                    for the faces that don't need to be drawn,
                                    for example where two faces are flush
                                    against each other, or a face faces away
                                    from any player and will never be seen (and
                                    so need not have a visible texture applied
                                to it).
                              </p>

                              <p>
                                One special texture for this purpose is
                                called Caulk.&nbsp; Faces with caulk on them
                                are not drawn, and so must never be
                                somewhere that a player could look at
                                it.&nbsp; You've probably played a map where
                                a caulked face is accidentally visible, and
                                you get a weird hall of mirrors effect while
                                you look at it.&nbsp; So you must ensure all
                                caulked faces cannot be seen.
                              </p>

                              <p>
                                <b
                                >In making a map you should be trying to
                                  achieve your design aims using the least
                                  number of brushes and the least number of
                                  visible faces as possible</b
                                >.&nbsp; One way to achieve the latter is to
                                create your brushes initially entirely from
                                the caulk texture.&nbsp; Then you
                                &quot;paint&quot; the visible faces with the
                                required texture, safe in the knowledge that
                                all the other faces are caulked.
                              </p>

                              <p>
                                For example, say you created a brush to be
                                used as floor in a room.&nbsp; You decide to
                                make the whole brush a wood texture and you
                                slot the brush into place.&nbsp; You forget
                                to later caulk the bits you can no longer
                                see, so you end up with 5 other faces that
                                the engine must consider when deciding what
                                to draw, when if they had all been caulk it
                                would not present this overhead.&nbsp; It
                                may seem like small fry, but a map like
                                2tanks has 8,000 brushes, and so about
                                48,000 faces, which translates to around
                                96,000 triangles to be considered and
                                possibly drawn.&nbsp; As you want to try to
                                keep the maximum number of triangles drawn
                                to under perhaps 40,000 you need to ensure
                                you <b>use caulk wherever possible</b>.
                              </p>

                              <p>
                                So let's start correctly with the flat
                                square we've created.&nbsp; We're going to
                                make that the floor.&nbsp; We caulk an
                                entire brush by selecting the brush and
                                clicking the Caulk button.

                                    At this stage it is unimportant that
                                    your \etmain folder contains extra
                                    PK3 files, like custom maps.&nbsp;
                                    But as you get deeper into the
                                    mapping it becomes important that
                                    your \etmain folder doe not have
                                    them.&nbsp; Radiant will show you
                                    the textures in those PK3s as
                                    available for you to choose.&nbsp;
                                    And you will not realize that the
                                    town you have lovingly created uses
                                    25 textures scattered across lots of
                                    other PK3s, and because they won't
                                    be in your PK3 when you proudly
                                    distribute your new map, everyone
                                    else will see the ugly yellow/black
                                    squares texture all over the place -

                                and error here as you go looking for the
                                texture you'd like.&nbsp; For now choose

                                will now show in your textures

                                show as red/black squares.
