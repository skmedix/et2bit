                                    chunk of it obscured the door.&nbsp; To
                                    clear this chunk out of the way we will edit
                                    the terrain manually by dragging their
                                    vertices about.&nbsp; Manual editing is
                                    something you should do last, because if you
                                    decide subsequently to regenerate the
                                    terrain with GtkGenSurf, you will lose your
                                    editing (unless you go to great lengths to
                                    retain your edits and restore them after the
                                                                regeneration - best avoided).

                                    view and drag in larger increments.&nbsp;
