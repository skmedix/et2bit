                                    The tank is the biggest single element that
                                    you definitely don't want to create from
                                    scratch.&nbsp; The Jagdpanther I first used
                                    was taken from the sample Goldrush map
                                    supplied by Radiant.&nbsp; It took some time
                                    to even recognize some of the tank
                                    components as being tank components,
                                    especially those that the author didn't
                                    happen to put immediately adjacent to the
                                    tank.&nbsp; It took even longer to
                                    understand what the sizeable script was
                                    doing and rework it to do what I wanted.
                                    <p>So to save you a lot of time and grief, I
                                    have made a <a href="tutorial/tank.zip" target="_blank">self-contained
                                    map</a> (we won't be using the tutorial map
                                    for this) and script, which includes a fully
                                    operational tank and tank barrier.&nbsp; I
                                    will explain all the components so that you
                                    can get them
                                    working in your own map.&nbsp; I have
                                    rationalized and re-ordered the script
                                    components (eg arranged them alphabetically,
                                    improved the comments, re-coded some
                                    elements for clarity) in an effort to make
                                    the scripting side as easy as
                                    possible.&nbsp; Note that even this minimal
                                    example tank script is 715 lines long -
                                    happily you only need to understand a
                                    fraction of
                                    it to make it work for you.&nbsp;

                                    <p>Run Radiant and open tank.map.&nbsp; You
                                    will see the tank (smothered in trigger
                                    boxes), which is repairable by
                                    the allies, and a barrier, which is
                                    constructible by the axis.</p>

                                    and have a go in ET.&nbsp; You should build
                                    the barrier, mend the tank and drive it to
                                    the barrier, destroy the barrier and then
                                    escort the tank (in an oval route back to
                                    the start) until it stops and fires the
                                    gun.&nbsp; Then come back to Radiant.</p>
                                    <p>Hide the ceiling brush, it will make
                                    examining the tank easier.&nbsp; We'll look
                                    at each component - get a 3D view that shows
                                    all the tank elements, like this:

                                    <p>Note that it doesn't matter where the
                                    tank or any of its components is actually
                                    placed in the map - it will be immediately
                                    placed on the first point of the route it
                                    will follow, when the map starts.
                                    <p>Use shift+alt+click to select the largest
                                    trigger box.&nbsp; We need to use
                                    shift+alt+click quite a bit because many of
                                    these components have origin brushes inside
                                    and we want to include them when we examine
                                    and hide each element.

                                    reasons why it can't, such as damage or a
                                    barrier).
                                    <p>Just use a regular mouse click on the 3D
                                    pane and press H to hide the trigger while

                                    <p>The boxes are splines, an entity called <b>info_train_spline_main</b>.&nbsp;
                                    Each spline points to the next spline along
                                    the track, by using the <b>target</b> key.</p>
                                    <p>I have made an oval circuit.&nbsp;
                                    Normally the splines define a winding route,
                                    not a circuit, and the last spline does not
                                    have a <b>target</b> key, as there is no
                                    next spline.</p>
                                    <p>The origin of the tank tracks will follow
                                    the origins of the splines.</p>
                                    <p>When you're making the route, the easiest
                                    way is to copy the last spline in the track
                                    so far, move it into place, and rename its
                                    targetname and target.&nbsp; Repeat as
                                    necessary.</p>
                                    <p>These example splines are actually too
                                    far apart.&nbsp; As a rule of thumb, they
                                    should be about 3 intersections apart at
                                    grid scale 7.&nbsp; This is because when the
                                    tank is damaged, it won't actually halt and
                                    smoke until it reaches the next
                                    spline.&nbsp; If you put them too far apart,
                                    a wrecked tank will go on too far.</p>
                                    <p>The pink boxes are <b>info_train_spline_controls</b>,
                                    and they are used to smooth the turning from
                                    one spline to the next.&nbsp; Without them,
                                    the tank will turn quite abruptly.&nbsp;
                                    Don't add them until you've laid out your
                                    route with some confidence that it won't
                                    change, because re-doing the spline controls
                                    is really tiresome and best avoided - so
                                    leave them to last.</p>
                                    <p><img border="0" src="images/tutorial/38/Image21.jpg" width="424" height="151"></p>
                                    <p>Select one and press N - you will see the
                                    only thing of interest is its name.&nbsp; I
                                    name them with the same name as the spline
                                    they are controlling, plus
                                    &quot;_c&quot;.&nbsp; Select a spline, like
                                    one of those at the pointy end of the
                                    circuit, and press N.&nbsp; You will see it
                                    has a <b>control</b> key.&nbsp; Splines only
                                    need a control key when you decide the tank
                                    movement from this spline to the next needs
                                    smoothing.</p>
                                    <p>In the picture above, the centre spline
                                    leads diagonally up to the left to the next
                                    spline.&nbsp; It has a control, the pink box
                                    to the left.&nbsp; So the tank won't go
                                    straight along the green arrow, it will bow
                                    out towards the pink box and then back to
                                    the target spline.</p>
                                    <p>This is best seen when you activate the <b>plot
                                    splines</b> feature.&nbsp; Click this
                                    button: <img border="0" src="images/tutorial/38/Image22.jpg" width="141" height="44">&nbsp;
                                    Nothing seems to happen.&nbsp; Press ESC.</p>

                                    <p>This shows with the white line, the path
                                    that the tank will actually follow.&nbsp;
                                    Handy to spot lumpy plots that need
                                    smoothing out with control splines.

                                    that will make the tank react to the barrier
                                    - without the script barrier detection, the

                                    through it.
