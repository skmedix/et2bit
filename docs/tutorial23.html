                                    Sooner or later you're going to want to make
                                    some outdoor environments, and unless it's
                                    all in a concreted area, you're going to
                                    need to make hills, dunes, grassy paths,
                                    snowy mounds etc.
                                    <p>The usual way of making brushes to make
                                    an object doesn't really work here, so
                                    instead people use a third party tool.&nbsp;
                                    One is EasyGen, which I don't use, and
                                    another is GtkGenSurf (a plugin included
                                    within Radiant) which I do.</p>
                                    <p>I haven't tried EasyGen so I can't
                                    comment on it.&nbsp; Also there's a new
                                    terrain-generating-kid on the block called FATE,
                                    which looks like it will be really good when
                                    finished.&nbsp; As I haven't used it I will
                                    stick to explaining how to do things in
                                    GtkGenSurf.</p>
                                    <p>GtkGenSurf will generate an area of
                                    terrain using lots of triangular brushes,
                                    like the box Toblerone comes in, with one
                                    end face the required texture and all the
                                    rest as caulk.&nbsp; You
                                    tell GtkGenSurf the area dimensions, the
                                    required size of triangles, the textures to
                                    be used and the contours you want and hit
                                    the Go button: GtkGenSurf then produces the
                                    terrain mesh, already grouped and ready for
                                    you to slot into place.</p>
                                    <p>The approach I take to making terrain is
                                    this:
                                    <ul>
                                      <li>Identify the area in the map that
                                        needs terrain - it will need to be
                                        rectangular although when the terrain is
                                        generated you can always chop away the
                                        stuff you don't want.</li>
                                      <li>Make the dimensions multiples of 256
                                        unless the terrain area is small, in
                                        which case you could use multiples of
                                        128 or 64 etc.&nbsp; The smaller the
                                        triangles you create, the more of them
                                        there will be.&nbsp; More triangles
                                        means nicer looking, but higher demands
                                        on the PC to draw them.&nbsp; I have
                                        always used 256 to date.</li>
                                      <li>I give GtkGenSurf a rough description
                                        of the required geography and do the
                                        first generation.</li>
                                      <li>If it looks roughly ok in Radiant,
                                        compile it and go run around in ET.</li>
                                      <li>Note down the imperfections, like this
                                        bit is too tall, that bit is too steep,
                                        etc.</li>
                                      <li>Go back to Radiant, delete the
                                        terrain, refine the description to
                                        GtkGenSurf and try again.</li>
                                      <li>Repeat as many times as necessary to
                                        get it mostly right.&nbsp; This might
                                        take 20 goes or so.</li>
                                      <li>For fine tuning I drag individual
                                        triangle vertices about in
                                        Radiant.&nbsp; This is very tiresome and
                                        to be done last.</li>
                                    </ul>

    brushes created this way for terrain should be of Detail type, otherwise
    you'd create a zillion portals in the compile.&nbsp; This also means that
    the undulating terrain does not block program line of sight, so for example
    the program will draw what's on the other side of a hill, even if a player
    couldn't see it.&nbsp; This is why in many maps you'll find buildings
    separating areas of the outdoors, so that the Structural brushes of the
    buildings can intervene between the Detail brushes of the terrain and reduce
    the demands on your graphics card and so improve the FPS.
    <p>This is why with large outdoor expanses like in Glider, 6Flags and
    2tanks, I've had to be careful with the amount of cosmetic detail included,
    because so much of the map will be drawn all the time.</p>

                                    GtkGenSurf is capable of producing terrain
                                    according to a number of styles, but I've
                                    found there is just one that seems to be the
                                    most practical, and I've stuck to it for all
                                    the terrain I've ever made.
                                    <p>It can base the undulations on the forms
                                    of waves, cylinders or fractals, or from a
                                    bitmap which specifies how the lumps and
                                    dips should be laid out.&nbsp; In practice
                                    I've found the bitmap method to be the most
                                    useful, so that is what I'll describe here.</p>
                                    <p>You can create a rectangular bitmap, ie a
                                    graphical file of type .BMP, and by
                                    colouring the pixels in it in varying shades
                                    of black to white, tell GtkGenSurf how you
                                    want the terrain to rise and fall.</p>
                                    <p>The tutorial map is 2048 * 2048.&nbsp;
                                    We'll make the terrain mesh size 256 units
                                    (1 box&nbsp; in grid scale 9) as this will
                                    be fine for the demonstration.&nbsp; 2048 /
                                    256 is 8, so the size of the bitmap will be
                                    8 * 8 pixels.</p>
                                    <p>The tutorial map currently has lots of
                                    stuff in the bottom left quarter, with the
                                    rest more or less empty.&nbsp; We'll make
                                    the empty 3/4 a bit hilly, and make the
                                    bottom 1/4 flatter.</p>
                                    <p>Use Paint Shop Pro or any graphics
                                    editing software to create an 8*8
                                    image.&nbsp; Make it <b>greyscale</b>, ie
                                    256 shades of grey only.&nbsp; A coloured
                                    BMP will not do.&nbsp; Fill it with black.</p>
                                    <p>Black represents 0 height.&nbsp; White
                                    means 255 high.&nbsp; The lighter the grey
                                    the greater the corresponding height, as
                                    interpreted by GtkGenSurf.</p>
                                    <p>Make the top &amp; right area some dappling of grey to
                                    give some slopes there.&nbsp; Here is
                                    a zoomed in image of an example 8*8 BMP.</p>
                                    <p><img border="0" src="images/tutorial/23/Image2.jpg" width="114" height="114"></p>
                                    <p>As can be seen I've left the bottom left
                                    corner flat for now, to avoid some of the
                                    features we've put there disappearing into
                                    the terrain.</p>

By the way, I generally place the GtkGensurf window top left on my screen and put the

<p>The <b>Surface</b> texture is the main texture that GtkGenSurf will use when
it makes the terrain.&nbsp; You can change this to the texture you want.&nbsp;
While I'm making the Ludendorff map I am using some grassy dirt texture.&nbsp;
You should pick an organic texture, something like grass, dirt, snow, gravel,
sand etc.&nbsp; There are some good grassy choices in the textures/temperate_sd
set, so for now I suggest you choose master_grass_dirt3.&nbsp; There is no
&quot;browse&quot; option, so you have to type it in.&nbsp; Don't put .tga or
.jpg at the end, just give the texture name.</p>
<p>The <b>Other</b> texture should be left as caulk.</p>
<p>The <b>Steep</b> texture is the texture to use for steep angles, defined as 60 degrees or more unless you change it.&nbsp; You would make this
either the same as the main surface, or if you wanted say hills to be grassy
mainly but rocky on the steep slopes, you'd give a rocky texture here.</p>

    get it wrong it's quite tiresome trying to convince it to use the right

Sometimes I flip the image upside down with the Elevation and spin it around
with the Azimuth to get the left and rights to match up - but then the top and
bottom are reversed. :(</p>

We have new terrain and the old floor overlapping.&nbsp; Either we'll need to
move everything up a bit, or move the old floor down.&nbsp; We can't just delete
the old floor because it forms part of the structural boundary of the map.&nbsp;
In general you'll make maps that are totally enclosed in hull caulk cubes, with
all 6 faces of the surrounding brushes given hull caulk, so that you are free to
create/delete anything inside it without worrying that you are making a hole
into the void.
<p>For the sake of simplicity we'll just move the floor down a notch.&nbsp; Get
a 2D side view.&nbsp; Change to grid size 7.&nbsp; Select the old floor brush
and move it down one notch.&nbsp; Click on the hull_caulk texture in the
textures window to give the whole brush that texture - we don't need it to be
drawn as snow any more.</p>
<p>Press ESC.&nbsp; Select all 4 of the surrounding wall brushes, and extend
them down one notch to meet the bottom hull_caulk brush, thus making the solid
surrounding cube again.</p>
<p>Press ESC.&nbsp; Your view should now look something like this:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/tutorial/23/Image15.jpg" width="558" height="194"></p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/tutorial/23/Image16.jpg" width="478" height="429"></p>
<p>If you generally don't like how the terrain has come out, rather than
specific detailed parts which we could fix by hand, select and delete the
terrain group and go back to GtkGenSurf.&nbsp; It will still have your details
so you can just Fix Points differently and try again.</p>
<p>If though you have exited Radiant, GtkGenSurf will not know your terrain
settings, so you will first have to use GtkGenSurf's <b>Open...</b> button and
tell it to open &quot;tutorial.ini&quot;.</p>
<p>An important detail to note is that there is a chunk of terrain inside the
building.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/tutorial/23/Image17.jpg" width="468" height="429"></p>
<p>It's at this point that it starts to become clear why we have taken such
trouble to make our buildings line up along big grid lines where possible.&nbsp;
Choose grid size 9 and get the overhead 2D and you can see the terrain triangles
that fall within the building.&nbsp; There are 6 of them.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/tutorial/23/Image18.jpg" width="446" height="420"></p>
<p>Select all 6 triangles in the 3D view, by first hiding the intervening floor
brushes, and delete them.&nbsp; Press shift+H to reveal the floor brushes again
and it should look like this:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/tutorial/23/Image19.jpg" width="355" height="342"></p>
<p>This will have revealed some gaps around the bottom of the building, as shown
here:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/tutorial/23/Image20.jpg" width="394" height="367"></p>
<p>The better solution to all this is to manually adjust the triangles in
Radiant, but we'll come to that in the next lesson.&nbsp; For now just select
all the floor brushes again and extend them downwards in the 2D side view using
grid scale 5.&nbsp; This will still leave a problem with the door, because the
terrain comes up the door a bit, and you'll see its caulk when opening the door
from the inside.&nbsp; We'll fix all this in the next lesson.</p>
<p>Save, compile and run around in your new hilly environment.</p>
<p>By the way, when taking screenshots from ET you usually have to increase the
brightness (eg 40%) and contrast (eg 20%) otherwise the JPG looks too gloomy.
<p><img border="0" src="images/tutorial/23/Image21.jpg" width="640" height="512"></p>
<p>Whether or not you can plant landmines will depend on the texture you

landmines.</p>

    neat way to see if a texture is actually a shader (ie there is a bit of

    textures window.&nbsp; Make sure you have pressed ESC first or you will
    apply the texture to any selected brushes/faces.
    <p>If the image is a plain texture, Radiant will report something like:
    ERROR: textures/egypt_floor_sd/block-16sq is not a shader, it's a texture.</p>
    <p>If it's a shader, ie there is an entry for it in a shader file, Radiant
    will open the shader file using Wordpad or whatever you have associated with
    .shader file types.&nbsp; Find the texture name in there and see if &quot;<font SIZE="2">surfaceparm
    landmine&quot; is given under it.&nbsp; If it is, you can plant landmines on
