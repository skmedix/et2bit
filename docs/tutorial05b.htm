    A quick way to find the area you want in your 2D window, which happens more
    often as the map gets bigger and more complicated, is to select one of the
    brushes of interest in the 3D view, and then press ctrl+tab.&nbsp; The
    selected brush is now centred in the 2D window.&nbsp; Usually you would
    press ctrl+tab twice more to return to the top down view.

                                    With floors and ceilings it is often the
                                    case that you accept some overlap with the
                                    walls, and don't worry about the strip of
                                    texture &quot;wasted&quot;.&nbsp; It can
                                    become just too grim trying to angle
                                    everything to prevent this.&nbsp; However,
                                    for the purpose of making quick progress we
                                    are creating this building sitting on the
                                    main exterior hull-caulked wall (which we've
                                    given a snow texture to on one side) and
                                    ordinarily you don't do that.&nbsp;
                                    Generally we will have created terrain and
                                    then set the building into it; or the
                                    building will be contained in its own volume
                                    of space, like our original tiny room.
                                    <p>In both of those cases you can usually
                                    create an efficient floor space, in the
                                    knowledge of what the player will actually
                                    be able to see.&nbsp; We'll get to this
                                    later.</p>
                                    <p>So for now we're being a little quick and
                                    dirty, but it will have a negligible effect
                                    on FPS so don't worry.</p>
                                    <p>Let's move our walls up a notch so that
                                    they sit on the new floor.</p>
                                    <p>Select all the walls in the 3D window by
                                    shift+clicking them all one after the other.</p>

                                    right-click/drag the building back into view
                                    if it has wandered off centre.</p>
                                    <p>Let's texture the floor.&nbsp; In the 3D view, ctrl+shift+click a floor
                                    brush face.</p>
                                    <p><img border="0" src="images/tutorial/05/Image25.jpg" width="640" height="393"></p>
                                    <p>Then ctrl+shift+<b>alt</b>+click the other
                                    brush's floor face.</p>
                                    <p>Then click Textures/egypt/egypt_floor_sd
                                    and click the block-16sq texture.</p>
                                    <p>Remember you can adjust the relative
                                    sizes of the Radiant windows so you can
                                    access more easily what you want at any
                                    given time.&nbsp; So I made the textures
                                    window bigger, clicked the texture I
                                    wanted, and then made it back to smaller
                                    again.&nbsp; Also I find the Texture
                                    Window Scale of 50% to usually be the most workable.</p>
                                    <p>Press ESC to deselect the faces and press
                                    <b>8</b> to go back to a big grid
                                    scale.&nbsp; Always worth doing as a

                                    cropper tool remains active.&nbsp; Press ESC

                                    <p>Now we can texture all the wall rim
                                    without having some texture wastefully drawn

                                    drawn if it won't be seen - but if you do
                                    this where practicable, you'll keep the FPS
                                    up and everyone playing will be grateful
                                    that your map doesn't play like running
