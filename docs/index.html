                        A Berlin street, 1945. Allies have to capture the street in house-to-house combat.
                        <p>The first buildings to capture are marked by a red flare (which turns blue when Allies capture the flag and red on Axis recapture).</p>
                        <p>Flags (which are always on the ground floor) must be held by the Allies for a total of 90 seconds to make the capture permanent.</p>
                        <p>At that point the flare turns yellow, indicating that Allies must now eliminate all Axis defenders in the building to secure it. So long as at least one Axis defender remains alive in the building, it remains unsecured.  When the flare turns yellow Axis have 20 seconds to re-occupy the building - after that time as soon as no Axis soldiers remain alive in the building it is secured.</p>
                        <p>When the first buildings are secured the yellow flares are extinguished and red flares are lit outside the next buildings to be captured. In this way Allies progress up the street, trying to secure a total of 7 buildings to win.</p>
                        <p>There are no dummy windows in the map, which means every window opening potentially conceals an enemy soldier: so advancing in the open street is a risky business. Allied cov ops will need to provide smoke cover and seek out enemy snipers to assist the advance of Allied troops.</p>
                        <p>The flares are an important element in the game, and
                        are produced using&nbsp; ET smoke generator entities.
                        Some players will have disabled smoke, perhaps to help
                        performance on low-spec machines or maybe to gain a
                        small visual advantage, and so will not be able to see
                        the flares.</p>
                        <p>To see flare smoke you need to set cg_wolfparticles
                        to 1 (on NQ you need cg_smokeparticles set to 1).

                        great new gameplay features.</p>
                        <p>Allies have to escort the battle-stained Tiger tank
                        along railway track through a station and its
                        surrounding village to escape.
                        <p>In a departure from the usual tank barrier format,
                        each of the main barrier objectives is a sequential double
                        objective.<br>

                        Axis are transporting armour reinforcements to the front line.  Allies must
                        destroy the 2 tanks on the trains before they arrive at their destination.
                        <p>All the action takes place on two moving trains adjacent on parallel tracks.</p>
                        <p>First objective is to blow up the crates that block the Allies path up the train.&nbsp;
                        This gives them access to the midtrain flag forward spawn, and sets them up for		the final push to the front of the train where the Tiger tanks are being transported.</p>
                        <p>Players can move through the carriages, or along the top or sides, and can jump from		one train to the other.</p>
                        <p>Passing overhead gantries and bridges help to prevent sniper domination, and quick		respawn times mean players are never missing from the action for long. The straightforward		layout also means it's quick to learn and no-one gets lost.</p>
                        <p>With a 10 minute map time limit, I believe it is best played in stopwatch mode.</p>
                        <p>Recommended 2-8 players per team, probably mayhem beyond that.

                        Set in the country manor of the board game Cluedo (Clue in the
                        U.S.), there is no real scenario - this is played <b> just
                        for laughs</b> as a break between &quot;proper&quot; maps.&nbsp;
                        Each game lasts about 10 minutes.
                        <p>Axis spawn in the Ballroom (centre top of the
                        map) and Allies in the Hall (centre bottom).<p>A flag
                        then randomly spawns in one of the seven other
                        rooms.&nbsp; The upper edge of the room's walls glow
                        white when the flag is active inside.<p>The flag can be
                        captured by either team, giving the white glow an inner
                        blue (allies) or red (axis) core to show the current
                        possessor.&nbsp; When the flag is held for a <i><b>total</b></i>
                        of 90 seconds by a team it is secured and removed from
                        the map.&nbsp; The white glow is removed and the inner
                        core remains to show that the room has been fought over
                        and which team secured it.<p>This process is repeated
                        until one team has secured four flags and is victorious.<p>Players
                        can move freely between the rooms and enter the
                        cellar.&nbsp; The doors are glass lined so that players
                        are aware of anyone camping the other side, which is
                        legitimate and likely to be the case.<p>Each room can be
                        entered or exited through its windows, and the four
                        corner rooms have secret passages which link them.
                        Players can also move around and over the building.<p>Each
                        of the seven flag rooms has a trap which is activated by
                        the lever in the corridor outside the room. Once a trap
                        is activated it cannot be re-used for 30 seconds.<p>The
                        traps make the interior of the room uncomfortable or
                        downright dangerous for its occupants, which helps to
                        shift players camping the flag. The player activating a
                        trap is teleported to a location outside the room, so he
                        can witness the carnage he has caused.<p>To make things
                        even more lively, the players will find there are all
                        sorts of places that engineers can plant mines to
                        surprise the unwary...<p>The action is fast and frantic,
                        with low respawn times to ensure all the players stay in
                        the thick of it.<p>Recommended for teams of between 2
                        and 12 per team.

                            The entire action centres on the race to deliver 6 gold crates into your team's vaults.

                            <p><u>GOLD CRATES</u><br>
		Grab each of your 6 gold crates one at a time and deliver them to the vault. Allied crates		from the East cages must go into the West vault, and vice-versa. Similarly for the Axis		crates in the North cages to the South vault and vice-versa. Arrows shown in team colours		(Allies=blue Axis=red) guide the way for the current objective.</p>

                            </u>There are four flag poles. They are NOT forward spawn points: instead they function like		a Command Post. Each flag captured improves your team's Charge speed:&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>			0 flags	= no bonus<br>
			1 flag	= small bonus<br>

                            <p><b>Expressway</b>. This provides a launch pad from the spawn point				to the opposite side of the map. Handy when the next objective is over there.<br>
                            <b>			Sleigh pad</b>. This provides a jump pad (located at the snowman) up				to the flying sleigh. The pad operates only when the sleigh is overhead.				When ridden, the sleigh will launch dual panzer strikes at the enemy base.

                        In 1942 the greatest threat to allied shipping was the mighty German battleship, Tirpitz. Her vast
                        size meant that the only dock on the Atlantic seaboard that could accommodate her was at St
                        Nazaire.
                        <p>So Operation Chariot was born, its mission to blow up the dock and neutralize the threat of the
                        Tirpitz.</p>
                        <p>The game commences with the allies having rammed the south gate with the destroyer HMS
                        Campbeltown. They must now attempt to destroy as many of the 6 main dockyard facilities as
                        possible.</p>
                        <p>There are 6 objectives to destroy, with victory being achieved to differing degrees at game end:<br>
                        <br>
                        0-1 objectives destroyed	DECISIVE Axis victory<br>
                        2 objectives destroyed		Major Axis victory<br>
                        3 objectives destroyed Marginal Axis victory<br>
                        <br>
                        4 objectives destroyed Marginal Allied victory<br>
                        5 objectives destroyed		MajorAllied victory<br>
                        6 objectives destroyed		DECISIVE Allied victory<br>
                        <br>
                        The map is very open and the allies can attack the objectives in any order - however, for the sake
                        of gameplay, they don't have it all their own way.</p>
                        <p>The Allies must deliver a demolition charge, taken from the ship's hold, to any objective before
                        it can be dynamited and destroyed. Two demolition charges are initially available, and when the
                        first two objectives have been destroyed another two demolition charges are made available in the
                        ship's hold. When the fourth objective has been destroyed, the final two charges become available.</p>
                        <p>This allows the allies to choose their targets, but limits them to attacking up to two at a time.</p>
                        <p>In addition, the axis have two barracks for their spawning.  One is near 3 objectives and the
                        second near the other 3 objectives.  Axis players always spawn in the South Barracks, but have a
                        passage that links the two barracks instantaneously - that is, an axis player at the South
                        Barracks can move immediately (teleport) to the East Barracks and vice versa.</p>
                        <p>This is like having a choice of 2 spawn points, but without the bother of selecting them on the
                        command map.</p>
                        <p>To guide axis players to the objectives under threat, there are ingame command maps in each
                        Barracks.  Indicators on these maps show which objectives are under attack, and which ones are
                        especially in danger because demolition charges have been placed.</p>
                        <p>By checking this map on spawning, axis players can take themselves immediately to the action.</p>

                        <p>RTCW Depot was one of my favourite RTCW maps which I
                        always hoped would turn up on ET.&nbsp; It never did, so
                        I have done a conversion to get this classic played
                        again.<p>Based on the revised Depot 2, it has a few
                        changes from the RTCW version but remains essentially
                        the same.<p>The enemy forces confront each other in a
                        rail depot.&nbsp; The Allies must destroy the Axis
                        Anti-Aircraft gun at the north end of the depot before
                        the Axis destroy the Allied Field HQ in the south.<p>Best
                        played with larger team sizes of say at least 8 per
                        team, to allow some players to attack the enemy
                        objective while some defend their own.

                        <p>I'm a big fan of Seawall Battery, and like many
                        players always wished you could get up onto the gun.<p>So
                        I thought I would do a conversion of this classic map
                        that would open up that area for some great firefights.<p>The
                        original map has a bit of a bottleneck at the ramp,
                        which lead to the development of a scriptfix to allow
                        the backdoor to be dynamited.<p>In this version there
                        are two frontal routes for the allied assault, so
                        the&nbsp; blowable-backdoor script isn't needed.<p>Changes from Seawall Battery
                        <ul>
                          <li>
                            <p>		Three additional primary objectives created for allies, making four in total:&nbsp;<br>
			destroy radar station (next to bunker)<br>
			destroy gun platform<br>
			destroy gun controls (same as in original map)<br>
			destroy power supply (at bottom of indoor railway slope)</li>
                          <li>
                            <p>		Assault ramp moved to the slope under the gun barrel, and time taken to build increased by 50%.</li>
                          <li>
                            <p>		Original location of assault ramp smoothed to allow allies to get up slope on foot.</li>
                          <li>
                            <p>		Axis can build barricade (satchel objective) to block the new slope.</li>
                          <li>
                            <p>		Players can now reach gun and gun platform from ramp and from inside gun room.</li>
                          <li>
                            <p>		New Axis-only door added at beach top leading directly to gun room, to allow Axis to better			defend the slope and the gun.</li>
                          <li>
                            <p>		New constructible (satchel objective) Axis-and-disguised-cov-op-only door added near			"power supply room", to slow allied access to it via gun room assault.</li>
                          <li>
                            <p>		Allied East Spawn moved closer to the lighthouse.</li>
                          <li>
                            <p>		Axis spawn time reduced to 20 secs.</li>

                        this classic ET map to make it sunny with unlimited
                        views to the horizon.&nbsp; To make it more interesting
                        than just having nicer weather, I included these

                        <ul>
                          <li>Extra Axis spawn location in the Road Hut - this
                            helps them fight back more quickly when Allies take
                            the Bunker.&nbsp; They will automatically spawn
                            there if the Allies capture the bunker, <i>unless</i>
                            the side door has been blown.</li>
                          <li>2 extra Allied primary objectives - destroy the
                            North and South Radar Stations.</li>
                          <li>A lot of the player clipping has been removed,
                            allowing players to get onto high places previously
                            not possible.</li>
                          <li>The tank in the garage can now be repaired by
                            Axis, and driven up the road to a defensive
                            position.</li>
                          <li>New terrain textures, and things like owl hoots
                            replaced with bird song.</li>
                          <li>Axis respawn time reduced.</li>
                          <li>Generator added behind door under wooden

                            in the bunker and the door being the main entrance

                        Chartwell, England, 1943.
                        <p>
                        Axis&nbsp;have launched a surprise paratroop attack on
                        Chartwell, the home of WInston Churchill, to steal the
                        plans for the D-Day invasion.</p>
                        <p>This is a small map of 20 mins duration, centred on
                        the Axis attempts to enter the house and obtain the
                        plans, best for 6-16 players per team.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p><u>Gameplay</u></p>
                        <p>Axis initially spawn at a building nearby, but they
                        can quickly enable their paratroopers to attack by
                        damaging the AA gun or the AA gun controls.&nbsp; With
                        either of these out of action, the Axis spawn location
                        is randomly changed to any location on the map for each
                        Axis respawn.&nbsp; This allows the Axis team to attack
                        from potentially any direction.</p>
                        <p>Allies need to repair both in order to force the Axis
                        back to the original spawn.</p>
                        <p>The main Allied spawn is in the basement.&nbsp; There
                        is an Allied-only flag in the pavilion, which if
                        captured gives the Allies the option of spawning outside
                        the house.</p>
                        <p>To get into the house, Axis must either dynamite the
                        main entrance (non-repairable) or satchel either of the
                        stairwell doors (repairable).</p>
                        <p>The Key must be taken from the ground floor dining
                        room to the safe in the top floor study.&nbsp; To get
                        into the study either of its doors must have been
                        destroyed (one by dyna, one by satchel, both
                        non-repairable).</p>
                        <p>On delivering the Key to the safe, the safe door
                        opens and the Plans can be stolen.&nbsp; They must be
                        taken to the Command Post in the grounds, and the
                        Command Post built to secure an Axis victory.</p>
                        <p>Although all of the windows visible in picture 3 can
                        be broken, getting out of the house with the Plans is a
                        little trickier than it seems, as the broken windows are
                        too narrow to jump through.</p>
                        <p>In this map Axis Cov Ops can set booby traps at the
                        AA gun and AA gun controls in an effort to safeguard the
                        paratroop attack from interruption.&nbsp; The booby
                        traps are detonated if an unwary allied soldier touches
                        the faint translucent white bar that reveals their
                        presence.&nbsp; Allied Cov Ops can defuse the booby
                        traps.</p>

                            1944, France, soon after D-Day. A company of Allied soldiers are trapped by superior Axis forces              near a french village. They must salvage a tank from the depot, force their way through              the village and escape along the railway track.&nbsp;
                            <p>This is a compact map, with the action focussed around the railway bridge, but the environment              is very open allowing plenty of choice and scope for tactics. All the buildings can be entered.
